# Encryption-Ransomeware
This is a Ransomeware created in Python.

It encrypts all the files in your Computer(Windows).

It asks for a safegaurd (password) to start the encryption to make sure you don't accidentally run it in your main computer.

safeguard password = 'start'

After the files are encrypted a key to decrypt the files is sent to me(server).

Refer ".py" files for source code

Run ".exe" file to test
